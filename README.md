# How It Was Made
This project was made using vanilla JS, HTML and CSS
This project was created for the purpose to help a previous employer calculate their inventory better. When I was the plant manager and operations coordinator for them, I was in charge of re-ordering inventory. Without any advanced software or any previous data whatesoever, I knew I had to create a system that would be accurate. I gathered data from previous years and created a excel spreadsheet. Gathering the data was easy but knowing when to recieve shipments with a 3 month lead time and having very limited warehouse space was the hardest part. I calculated the date that inventory would be close to zero and included the lead time and transportation. This was effective but very time consuming. So I decided to create a program that would help them with their re-ordering. 

# Optimizations 
In the future, I would include a tab that includes the latest in manufacturing news. This would be done with a web scraper API. I would include a filter so that the user can specifically look for news that pertain to them. 

# Lessons Learned 
I learned that I like mobile first development. I used to do desktop first and then at the end have to worry about the media queries and fitting in a hamburger menu. This would be very time consuming and personally, I really loathed this part. So I decided to take a new approach and the building stage feels smoother.
